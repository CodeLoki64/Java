# Question 1: Welcome to JAVA

The Question here introduces to the most basic concept in JAVA, the *output* function of Java

we use,
```java
System.out.print("text");
System.out.println("text");
```
to print text to the console
we use *System.out.print()* for printing normally and *System.out.println()* prints a given output and then the cursor is sent to next line or performs a line break.
